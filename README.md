# Sleep2Earn

## üåô Overview

Sleep2Earn is an innovative blockchain-based application that addresses the growing epidemic of sleep deprivation in our fast-paced world. By transforming healthy sleep habits into tangible rewards, we're revolutionizing how people prioritize rest and recovery.

Poor sleep quality and insufficient rest have become alarming public health concerns, negatively impacting:
- Daily productivity and cognitive performance
- Long-term mental health and emotional wellbeing
- Physical health outcomes and immune function
- Overall quality of life

Sleep2Earn creates a positive feedback loop by rewarding users with cryptocurrency tokens for achieving their personalized sleep goals. What sets us apart is our commitment to data privacy - all sleep verification is handled through secure zkTLS protocols, ensuring users maintain complete ownership of their sensitive health information while still benefiting from the reward system.
